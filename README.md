# Karmabunny Interfaces

Base interfaces for interoperability between projects.



## Usage

Install with Composer.

```sh
composer require karmabunny/interfaces
```


## Code standard

There is nothing functional in this package and it will stay that way.

There are no dependencies.

Ugly as it is (and repetitive) all interfaces are suffixed with `Interface`.
That's just the path we've chosen and we're sticking with it.

Use strong types wherever possible.
